# 1. Data visualisation basics 
## What is data? (Participative activity adapted from ['Future Proof and FAIR Research Data: Open Data Management Best Practices and First Steps'](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/node/2603))(45 mins)

* Form groups (can be randomly allocated using a survey tool) and discuss:
 - In your discipline, what are research data?
 - How do they look like?  
 - How can you interpret them?
 - Share results and discuss as a group
* Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences (HASS) research produces and work with data  
* These can take many forms (i.e. discussion outcomes)
* HASS research involves **enrichment** of data where layers of interpretation are added to original content: the value of annotations.
* Need to identify original (primary) and secondary data i.e. text annotation on work or corpora.

## The importance of visual representation
* Visual representation is the key activity of data visualisation
* Visuals help researcher to communicate results and/or research journey.
* Comprehension of results and rationale by broader public. From knowledge to comprehension.

## Informing Vs communicating: From perception to comprehension
* Perception, interpretation, comprehension

### Perception to comprehension: A visual journey

Some real data to begin our discussion

[The Box Office Mojo by IMDPro](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/2023W01/?area=AU&ref_=bo_wey_table_7) an open database of movie releases and box office revenue.

![From BOM to Excel with the help of Python](bom_to_excel.png)

![Perception](mov_fig_1.png)
* What features are observable?
* Where are the largest, mid-sized and smallest values?
* Where are the most and the last?
* Where is the _average_?


![Interpretation aided by design](mov_fig_2.png)
* Are more features perceivable?


![Drawing interpretations helped by extra knowledge](mov_fig_3.png)
* What features are interesting?
* What features are unexpected?
* What features are important given the context?

![Comprehending by providing further info](mov_fig_4.png)
* What has been learnt?
* Has the experience had an impact emotionally?
* What does one do with this information?

 

## 2. The design process 
* There is no perfect visualisation, but many ways to do the same task.

### Visual encoding: marks and attributes
 * Marks represent items of data (lines, points, shapes) *not* their value
 * Attributes visual variations of marks (colour, size, position) that describe the *value* associated with a particular marker.

### Principle of proportional ink
 **Plot elements must be proportional to the data values represented.**

     Problems with this figure?
    
  ![Why is the principle important?](mov_fig_6.png)


### Data resolution and overlapping points
* Arises when data has low resolution: the scale used to measure our data is too large so individual observations are hard to tell apart from each other.
* Data points will have the same value even if they represent different entities or events.

**The data**
The Early English Books Online database ((EEBO)[https://www.proquest.com/eebo]) contains digital samples of almost every work printed in English from 1470 to 1700.
![EEBO sub-sample](EEBO_plot_no_jitter.png)

* Problems with this visualisation?

A first solution: Displacing each point randomly by a little amount (_jitter_) so that individual points become visible.
![EEBO jitter](EEBO_plot_jitter.png)

Careful! too much jitter can also affect the integrity of the visualisation. 
![EEBO too much jitter](EEBO_plot_too_jitter.png)

### Context to facilitate comprehension

#### Each visualisation requires different solutions to work, but there are some minimum requirements to improve communication with audience

**The data**

[A report published in 2011 by The Economist](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2011/12/02/corrosive-corruption) revealed a correlation between corruption and development. Here we updated this report using data from 2012 to 2017 compiled by [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/data/).

**Variables**

* UN's Human Development index (HDI): Combined score for health level, educational level and living standards. Ranges from 0.0 to 1.0.
* Perceived corruption: Transparency international's score of perception of corruption. Ranges from 1 to 100. Higher scores represent less perceived corruption. 
* Happiness score: National average response to a question of life evaluation measured by the Cantril life ladder. Scaled from 0 to 100. Higher scores denote a more positive perception.

## Legends and axis labels
* Every figure needs a title conveying to the reader what the visualisation is about.
* Legend help readers to identify marks and attributes easily. 
* Axis labels give to reader a sense of time (days, months, years, centuries), magnitude (hundreds, thousands, millions), unit (for physical attributes), or orientation (North, South, East, West).

![corruption_hdi](full_corruption_hdi_minimal.png)

## Context and annotations
* Help reader going from perception to comprehension.
* Make comparisons possible and the identification of extreme cases
* Put data into a broader context

![corruption_hdi_presentation](full_corruption_hdi_presentation.png)
## Captions and placement of titles
* Where is the visualisation going to be presented: print Vs. display

Features:
* Filtering: User controls the data to be displayed by including or excluding certain categorial groups or values
* Highlighting: Emphasises particular aspects of the data by highlighting specific values. Summarises values
* Participating: Ask users to input data to produce a display as for example, quizzes and surveys.
* Navigating: Accessing multiple views or gaining a more detailed display by zooming in.
* Animation: Can give an spatial or temporal dimension to data.

Features are not mutually exclusive and can be mixed to facilitate comprehension.

Questions:

* What are the main features used on each visualisation?
* How many, and what variables are quantified by the features used?
* Are some of the features redundant?


 
 # 5. Colour theory and digital colour palettes
 
 Color theory is the study of how colors interact with one another and how they can be combined to create aesthetically pleasing designs. It explores the science and psychology behind colors and how they can be used to create visual impact and meaning.

Color theory is based on the color wheel, which is a circular diagram that shows the primary, secondary, and tertiary colors. The primary colors are red, blue, and yellow, and they cannot be created by mixing other colors. Secondary colors are created by mixing two primary colors together, such as purple (red and blue) and green (blue and yellow). Tertiary colors are created by mixing a primary color with a secondary color, such as red-orange or blue-green.

One important aspect of color theory is color harmony, which refers to the way colors are combined to create a pleasing visual effect. There are several ways to achieve color harmony, including complementary colors, analogous colors, and triadic colors. Complementary colors are opposite each other on the color wheel, such as red and green, and they create a strong visual contrast when used together. Analogous colors are next to each other on the color wheel, such as blue and green, and they create a harmonious and calming effect. Triadic colors are evenly spaced on the color wheel, such as red, yellow, and blue, and they create a vibrant and balanced color scheme.

Another aspect of color theory is color psychology, which explores the emotional and psychological effects of colors. For example, red is often associated with passion and energy, while blue is associated with calmness and trust. Different colors can evoke different emotions and moods, and designers can use this knowledge to create designs that convey a particular message or feeling.
 
 
 Psychology of Colour
 
The psychology of color explores how different colors can affect our emotions, moods, and behaviors. While color psychology is not an exact science and can vary based on cultural contexts and personal experiences, there are some general associations and meanings that can be applied to colors.

Red is often associated with passion, excitement, and danger. In Western cultures, red is often associated with love and Valentine's Day. In China, red is considered a lucky color and is associated with prosperity and happiness. In India, red is often worn by brides and is seen as a symbol of purity and fertility.

Yellow is associated with happiness, optimism, and warmth. In Western cultures, yellow is often associated with sunshine and summer. In Japan, yellow is considered a sacred and imperial color. In Egypt, yellow is associated with mourning.

Blue is associated with calmness, trust, and serenity. In Western cultures, blue is often associated with the ocean and the sky. In China, blue is associated with immortality and longevity. In Iran, blue is associated with mourning and depression.

Green is associated with nature, growth, and balance. In Western cultures, green is often associated with environmentalism and sustainability. In Islamic cultures, green is considered a sacred color and is associated with paradise.

Purple is associated with royalty, luxury, and creativity. In Western cultures, purple is often associated with nobility and wealth. In Thailand, purple is considered a mourning color.

White is associated with purity, cleanliness, and innocence. In Western cultures, white is often associated with weddings and new beginnings. In China, white is associated with death and mourning.

Black is associated with sophistication, elegance, and mystery. In Western cultures, black is often associated with formal events and mourning. In Japan, black is considered a color of honor and respect.

While these are just some general associations and meanings of colors, it's important to remember that color psychology can vary based on cultural contexts and personal experiences. Designers should consider the cultural nuances of color meanings when creating designs for a specific audience or market. By understanding the psychology of color and its cultural nuances, designers can create effective and meaningful designs that resonate with their audience.
